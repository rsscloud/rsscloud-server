# @rsscloud/client-app

An interactive **test harness** for the [rssCloud](https://github.com/rsscloud/rsscloud-server)
notification protocol and [WebSub](https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/) — the subscriber +
publisher end, the mirror of `@rsscloud/core` (the hub end). Unlike most of this monorepo
it's designed to be deployable as a **public utility**: it can test a hub running locally,
a hub deployed live, or any third party's rssCloud/WebSub implementation.

The Express app ([`client.js`](client.js)) serves one unified control box — pick a protocol
(rssCloud REST, rssCloud XML-RPC, or WebSub), point it at this harness's own test feed or an
arbitrary external one, and Subscribe/Ping/Publish/Unsubscribe. Every action is asynchronous
(no page navigation); the outcome — and everything this harness receives — shows up as a
combined, live traffic log via [`@andrewshell/socklog`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@andrewshell/socklog).
All the protocol wire work lives in [`lib/`](lib/) and is reusable on its own.

## Sessions

Visiting `/` mints a session id and redirects to `/s/<id>` — that path prefix is the root
for everything this browser session does: the UI, its test feed(s), and every callback route
a hub calls back into (`/notify`, `/RPC2`, `/websub-callback`). This keeps concurrent public
users' logs, feeds, and subscriptions from ever crossing.

A session's callback/feed routes 404 once it's gone `SESSION_CALLBACK_IDLE_MS` (default 1h)
without an outgoing action — a hub that keeps probing a long-abandoned subscription gets
nothing back. The UI itself keeps working past that point (acting again resumes it). A
session is fully evicted from memory after `SESSION_GC_IDLE_MS` (default 24h) of inactivity,
independent of the callback cutoff, so a long-running public deployment doesn't leak memory.

Both cutoffs are suspended while a session has a live socklog connection — leaving the page
open (e.g. watching an external feed overnight) counts as active use on its own, even with no
button clicked, so its callback surface stays reachable and it's never evicted.

## Running

From the repo root:

```bash
pnpm client          # start in watch mode (nodemon)
```

Or from this package:

```bash
pnpm --filter @rsscloud/client-app run dev    # watch mode
pnpm --filter @rsscloud/client-app start      # one-shot
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust — the defaults target a hub at
`http://localhost:5337` (this repo's own server, run locally) with loopback exempted from
the outbound SSRF guard for local dev. See `.env.example` for the full list of env vars
(`DOMAIN`, `PORT`, `HUB_SERVER_URL`, `CLIENT_FETCH_ALLOW_CIDRS`, `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`,
`SESSION_CALLBACK_IDLE_MS`, `SESSION_GC_IDLE_MS`, `SESSION_GC_INTERVAL_MS`). Requires Node 22+.

Every outbound call this harness makes (feed discovery, pleaseNotify/ping, WebSub `hub.*`) is
routed through the same SSRF-guarded fetch `@rsscloud/core` gives the hub server — refusing
loopback/private/link-local targets by default, since a public deployment lets any visitor
make it originate arbitrary requests. `CLIENT_FETCH_ALLOW_CIDRS` re-enables loopback for local
dev; delete it before deploying publicly.

## Docker

```bash
docker build -f apps/client/Dockerfile -t rsscloud-client .
docker run -p 9000:9000 --env-file apps/client/.env rsscloud-client
```

See [`examples/dockge/compose.yaml`](../../examples/dockge/compose.yaml) for a stack pairing
this harness with the hub server.

## The `lib/` API

`require('./lib')` exposes these helpers (CommonJS):

- **`createRssCloudClient({ serverUrl, fetch? })`** — send `pleaseNotify` (subscribe) and
  `ping` (publish) to a hub over an injectable `fetch`. Returns `{ pleaseNotify, ping }`.
- **`createWebSubClient({ serverUrl, path?, fetch? })`** — send WebSub `hub.*` requests to a
  hub's front door (`path` defaults to `/websub`). Returns `{ subscribe, unsubscribe, publish }`;
  each resolves to the hub's raw reply (`{ status, body }`) and does **not** throw on a non-2xx.
- **`readVerification(query)`** — given a callback GET's query, return
  `{ mode, topic, challenge, leaseSeconds }` when it's a WebSub intent-verification request
  (the subscriber must echo `challenge` verbatim), else `null`.
- **`renderCloudFeed(feed)`** — emit an RSS 2.0 document carrying the `<cloud>` element that
  advertises a hub. Pass `hub` (a URL) to also advertise a WebSub hub via
  `<atom:link rel="hub">` plus a `rel="self"` link.
- **`buildNotifyResponse(success)`** — build the XML-RPC notify acknowledgement a subscriber
  returns to the hub.
- **`discoverFeed({ url, fetch? })`** — fetch an arbitrary feed URL and report what it
  advertises: `{ rssCloud: {domain,port,path,registerProcedure,protocol} | null, webSub:
  {hubUrl} | null, error? }`. Backs the UI's "enter a feed URL" discovery action.
- **`parseFeedDiscovery(xmlText)`** — the parsing half of `discoverFeed`, given an
  already-fetched body.

Two more app-root modules (not part of the portable `lib/` barrel, since they're
Express/`ws`-coupled):

- **`lib/session-store.js`**'s `createSessionStore({ now?, idGenerator? })` — the in-memory
  per-session state (request log, feed items, WebSub secrets, idle tracking) described above.
- **`session-sockets.js`**'s `createSessionSockets({ sessionStore })` — the per-session
  socklog WebSocket feed (`/s/:id/logs`), returning `{ attach(server), broadcast(sessionId,
  entry) }`.
- **`lib/guarded-fetch.js`**'s `createGuardedFetch({ allowCidrs?, timeoutMs? })` — the
  SSRF-guarded fetch described above.

### WebSub

```js
const { createWebSubClient } = require('./lib');

const hub = createWebSubClient({ serverUrl: 'http://localhost:5337' });

await hub.subscribe({
    callbackUrl: 'http://localhost:9000/s/<session-id>/websub-callback',
    topicUrl: 'http://localhost:9000/s/<session-id>/rss-01.xml',
    leaseSeconds: 3600, // optional; the hub clamps to its configured bounds
    secret: 's3cr3t' // optional; opts into a signed X-Hub-Signature delivery
});

await hub.publish({ topicUrl: 'http://localhost:9000/s/<session-id>/rss-01.xml' }); // hub.mode=publish
await hub.unsubscribe({ callbackUrl: '…', topicUrl: '…' });
```

### Subscribe

```js
const { createRssCloudClient } = require('./lib');

const client = createRssCloudClient({ serverUrl: 'http://localhost:5337' });

const { status, body } = await client.pleaseNotify({
    protocol: 'https-post',
    callback: { port: 443, path: '/notify' },
    feedUrl: 'https://feed.example/rss'
});
```

`callback.domain` is optional and selects the hub's verification flow: when given, the hub
verifies against that host (with a challenge for `http-post`/`https-post`); when omitted, the
hub uses the caller's address. `pleaseNotify` resolves to the hub's raw reply
(`{ status, body }`) and does **not** throw on a non-2xx — inspect `status` yourself. Pass
`protocol: 'xml-rpc'` to subscribe over the `/RPC2` front door instead of REST.

### Ping

```js
const { createRssCloudClient } = require('./lib');

const client = createRssCloudClient({ serverUrl: 'http://localhost:5337' });

await client.ping({ feedUrl: 'https://feed.example/rss' }); // REST /ping
await client.ping({ transport: 'xml-rpc', feedUrl: '…' }); // /RPC2
```

### Feed discovery

```js
const { discoverFeed } = require('./lib');

const { rssCloud, webSub, error } = await discoverFeed({
    url: 'https://feed.example/rss'
});
// rssCloud: { domain, port, path, registerProcedure, protocol } | null
// webSub:   { hubUrl } | null
```
